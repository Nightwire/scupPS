# Hardware Inventory Classes
To use all Helpdesk functions of scupPS, a few more Hardware Inventory Classes need to be inventoried.
You can import [this mof file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RobinBeismann/scupPS/master/docs/assets/scupPS_hardwareInventory.mof) which includes all required classes.

If you don't use the Helpdesk Functionality of scupPS then you don't need to import those fields.
